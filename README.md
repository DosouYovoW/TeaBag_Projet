# Tea Bag Index to Assess Carbon Decomposition Rate in Cranberry Agroecosystems
**Abstract:** In cranberry production systems, stands are covered by 1–5 cm of sand every 2–5 years to
stimulate plant growth, resulting in alternate layers of sand and litter in soil upper layers. However,
almost intact twigs and leaves remain in subsurface layers, indicating a slow decomposition rate.
The Tea Bag Index (TBI) provides an internationally standardized methodology to compare litter
decomposition rates (k) and stabilization (S) among terrestrial ecosystems. However, TBI parame-
ters may be altered by time-dependent changes in the contact between litter and their immediate
environment. The aims of this study were to determine the TBI of cranberry agroecosystems and
compare it to the TBI of other terrestrial ecosystems. Litters were standardized green tea, standard-
ized rooibos tea, and cranberry residues collected on the plantation floor. Litter decomposition was
monitored during two consecutive years. Added N did not affect TBI parameters (k and S) due to
possible N leaching and strong acidic soil condition. Decomposition rates (k) averaged (mean ± SD)
9.7 × 10−3 day−1 ± 1.6 × 10−3 for green tea, 3.3 × 10−3 day−1 ± 0.8 × 10−5 for rooibos tea, and
0.4 × 10−3 day−1 ± 0.86 × 10−3 for cranberry residues due to large differences in biochemical
composition and tissue structure. The TBI decomposition rate (k) was 0.006 day−1 ± 0.002 in the low
range among terrestrial ecosystems, and the stabilization factor (S) was 0.28 ± 0.08, indicating high
potential for carbon accumulation in cranberry agroecosystems. Decomposition rates of tea litters
were reduced by fractal coefficients of 0.6 for green tea and 0.4 for rooibos tea, indicating protection
mechanisms building up with time in the tea bags. While the computation of the TBI stabilization
factor may be biased because the green tea was not fully decomposed, fractal kinetics could be used
as additional index to compare agroecosystems.
